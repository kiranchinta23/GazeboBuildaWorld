# GazeboBuildaWorld

To create a simulation world for all your projects in this Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program.

1. Build a single floor wall structure using the Building Editor tool in Gazebo. Apply features,color, and texture to the          structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
2. Model a object, using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. Model links should be connected with joints.
3. Import the structure and two instances of the model inside an empty Gazebo World.
4. Import at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in the existing Gazebo world.
5. Write a C++ World Plugin to interact with your world. Code should display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as we          launch the Gazebo world file
